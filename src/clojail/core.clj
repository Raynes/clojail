  "This function creates a sandbox function that takes a tester. A tester is a set of objects
   that you don't want to be allowed in code. It is a blacklist.

   Optional arguments are as follows:

   :timeout, default is 10000 MS or 10 seconds. If the expression evaluated in the sandbox
   takes longer than the timeout, an error will be thrown and the thread running the code
   will be stopped.

   :namespace, the namespace of the sandbox. The default is (gensym \"sandbox\").
   :context, the context for the JVM sandbox to run in. Only relevant if :jvm? is true. It
   has a sane default, so you shouldn't need to worry about this.

   :jvm?, if set to true, the JVM sandbox will be employed. It defaults to true.

   :transform, a function to call on the result returned from the sandboxed code, before
   returning it, while still within the timeout context.

   :init, some (quoted) code to run in the sandbox's namespace, but outside of the sandbox.

   :refer-clojure, true or false. If true (the default), automatically refer-clojure in the ns.
   You might want to set this to false at some point if you're working with the namespace in the
   :init key.

   This function will return a new function that you should bind to something. You can call
   this function with code and it will be evaluated in the sandbox. The function also takes
   an optional second parameter which is a hashmap of vars to values that will be passed to
   with-bindings. Since Clojure 1.3, only vars explicitly declared as dynamic are able to be
   rebound. As a result, only those vars will work here. If this doesn't work for you,
   read about the :init key."
